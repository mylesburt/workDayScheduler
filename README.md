Work Day Scheduler - Developed by Myles Burt

Homework submission has meet the criteria of displaying the current day at the top of the calender, having timeblocks for standard business hours, colour-coded timeblocks to indicate whether it is the past, present or future, can enter an event when timeblock is clicked.

However, the homework has failed to apply local store to save text with the timeblock so that when the page is refreshed the saved event persists,

I hope my attempts attrying to execute local storage are seen with the javascript external file, I believe I can do it but not within the deadline.

I plan to return to Week 5 again to better understand local storage and it's implementations.

PSEUDO-CODE to local storage with Work Day Scheduler...

WHEN I type with the input of a timeblock, THEN that value is recorded.
WHEN the save button is pressed, THEN the item is placed in local storage.
WHEN the item is placed in local storage, THEN it is ready to replace the previous value when the window is refreshed.
